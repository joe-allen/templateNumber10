			<p>Dear reader,</p>

			<p>On September 30th, just a few days from now&hellip;</p>

			<p>Most Americans will miss the ONLY chance they&rsquo;ll ever have of retiring with a fortune.</p>

			<p>And they will regret it for the rest of their lives.</p>

			<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to be one of them.</p>

			<p>You see, if you&rsquo;re anything like most Americans...</p>

			<p>You probably want nothing to do with cryptocurrencies after the crash a few months ago&hellip;</p>

			<p>And considering the bloodbath we witnessed, I can&rsquo;t say I blame you.</p>

			<p>But I&rsquo;m here to tell you that if you choose to ignore cryptocurrency in the coming weeks...</p>

			<p>It could be the biggest mistake of your life.</p>

			<p>Because while most investors think that crypto is dead and never coming back&hellip;</p>

			<p>The &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; on Wall Street is frantically loading up on as much Bitcoin as they can get their hands on...</p>

			<p>Because a few days from now, On September 30, 2018...</p>

			<p>One of the biggest agencies of the U.S. government will publish a press release...</p>

			<p>One that could have a profound impact on your wealth and the wealth of your family for generations to come.</p>

			<p>And this is NOT some speculation. Take a look at this official letter published by this government agency&hellip;</p>
			<img alt="Sept 30" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_BitcoinsFinalBullRun_Sept30.png" />
			<p>It says in plain English&hellip;</p>

			<p>They WILL make an announcement just days from now...</p>

			<p>And I&rsquo;m convinced it will go down in the history books as the single catalyst that catapults crypto into the mainstream&hellip;</p>

			<p>Sending Bitcoin on its biggest bull run ever&hellip;</p>

			<p>And making it so expensive that most Americans will only be able to afford a tiny fraction of a coin. According to my research, I&rsquo;m 100% certain that&hellip;</p>

			<h3>Once the U.S. Government issues this shocking Bitcoin statement &hellip;</h3>

			<h3>They&rsquo;ll release a wealth explosion<br class="hidebr" />
				like we&rsquo;ve never seen before</h3>

			<p>An estimated $5.1 trillion windfall of institutional money that could send Bitcoin straight to $100,000 within a matter of weeks&hellip;</p>

			<p>&hellip; And $1 million in the following months.</p>

			<p>And it will begin on September 30th!</p>

			<p>But I have to warn you&hellip;</p>

			<p>What you&rsquo;re about to read is controversial&hellip;</p>

			<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve made millions of dollars as a cryptocurrency investor...</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve received hundreds of hate tweets for my cryptocurrency predictions.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been called a &ldquo;fake news guy&rdquo; and a &ldquo;con artist.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>But guess what?</p>

			<p>I saw the recent crypto crash coming from a mile away&hellip;</p>

			<p>In fact, as you&rsquo;ll see in a moment, I went on live TV and predicted that 95% of cryptos would turn out to be worthless.</p>

			<p>So, if you sat on the sidelines during the crypto boom of 2017&hellip;</p>

			<p>When countless people became overnight &ldquo;crypto millionaires&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

			<p>Or if you&rsquo;ve lost money with the recent pullback&hellip;</p>

			<p>You now have ONE last chance to cash in on the explosive cryptocurrency markets.</p>

			<p>You simply position yourself in the right cryptocurrencies before September 30th...</p>

			<p>And you could stand to turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune&hellip; in a matter of months.</p>

			<p>I know how crazy that sounds&hellip;</p>

			<p>But once you see the evidence for yourself, you&rsquo;ll know that what I&rsquo;m telling you is 100% true.</p>

			<p>Why am I so certain?</p>

			<h3>Because Every Bitcoin Crash Throughout History Follows the Same Three-Step Pattern&hellip;</h3>

			<h3>&hellip; A Pattern that Could Make You Rich Starting on September 30th!</h3>

			<p>No, I&rsquo;m not talking about a &ldquo;Fibonacci retracement&rdquo; or a &ldquo;double top reversal&rdquo; pattern or anything complicated like that&hellip;</p>

			<p>This pattern is so simple that you can use it even if you know nothing about cryptos&hellip;</p>

			<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve never invested in your life.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s even more astounding&hellip;</p>

			<p>This pattern has a 100% track record of success.</p>

			<p>I like to call it the &ldquo;100X Bitcoin Formula&rdquo;...</p>

			<p>Because every time Bitcoin has dropped over 70%, this pattern has occurred with a 100% certainty.</p>

			<p>And those who followed this formula the last three times it has occurred in Bitcoin&rsquo;s history...</p>

			<p>Would have had the chance to walk away with an average gain of 10,570%...</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s more than 100X your money.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s like playing the lottery knowing the winning ticket!</p>

			<p>In fact, last time I used this formula&hellip;</p>

			<p>I personally made $1.8 million with a group of venture capital investors.</p>

			<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about just buying Bitcoin, the &ldquo;granddaddy&rdquo; of all cryptocurrencies.</p>

			<p>Although you could do well by simply buying and holding Bitcoin&hellip;</p>

			<p>You could make even MORE money with the three smaller cryptos I&rsquo;ll discuss below.</p>

			<p>And it&rsquo;s all culminating with the big date on September 30th.</p>

			<p>Even better&hellip;</p>

			<h3>History Proves That ANYONE Who Followed This Pattern Made a Fortune...</h3>

			<p>Take Alan A., a 47-year-old San Franciscan, for example...</p>

			<p>Less than two years ago, he invested in cryptocurrency just as this pattern was starting to appear...</p>

			<p>And within six months, his $8,500 initial investment was worth $7.5 million!</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s a return of 88,000%... in a matter of months!</p>

			<p>Incredible, right?</p>

			<p>And he&rsquo;s not the only one...</p>

			<p>Sean I. from New York invested $15,000 in cryptocurrency...</p>

			<p>And this pattern allowed him to turn his initial stake into a $3 million fortune&hellip;</p>

			<p>In less than two years.</p>

			<p>After becoming a crypto millionaire, he said:</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Anybody right now with half a mind and at least four fingers can click some buttons and get in on this inevitable exponential rise in crypto and make <u>an INSANE amount of money</u>.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>24 year old Kevin A. identified this formula and sold his computer so he had money to invest in cryptocurrency&hellip;</p>

			<p>And within six months his investment ballooned into over $1 million!</p>

			<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not making this up&hellip;</p>

			<h3>This Pattern Has Worked Over and Over Again, 100% of the Time</h3>

			<p>So imagine how your life could change after this announcement on September 30th. Picture this scenario:</p>

			<p>You wake up sometime in the early afternoon, just months from now, to the sound of waves crashing against the shore nearby.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;re lying in bed in your dream home...</p>

			<p>&hellip; which is perfectly situated on one of the most beautiful and luxurious beach fronts in the world.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;ve almost forgotten what it&rsquo;s like to be shocked awake by the sound of an alarm clock every morning.</p>

			<p>You check your bank account balance on your phone, just for fun.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;re now a multimillionaire&hellip;</p>

			<p>It feels like a dream, but the newspaper on your front doorstep proves that it&rsquo;s not.</p>

			<p>The headline story reads&hellip;</p>
			<div class="newsquote">
				<p>"Bitcoin reaches new
					<br>ALL-TIME HIGH and mints a <br>new batch of millionaires."</p>
			</div>

			<div class="newsquote2">
				<p>"Bitcoin reaches new
					<br>ALL-TIME HIGH and mints a new <br class="hidebr">batch of millionaires."</p>
			</div>


			<p>You smile, knowing you&rsquo;re one of them.</p>

			<p>And the best part is, your friends and family know they never have to worry about money again&hellip;</p>

			<p>Because you were one of the few people in the world who saw this 100X Bitcoin pattern developing&hellip; and took action.</p>

			<p>This could be your reality, beginning just a few days from now...</p>

			<p>Because this 3 step pattern is developing again <em>right now</em> as you read this page.</p>

			<p>And it has worked with 100% accuracy.</p>

			<p>You just need to ignore the clueless media and follow the pattern. Let me show you...</p>

			<h3>In 2011 The Mainstream Media<br class="hidebr" />
				Declared Bitcoin Dead&hellip;</h3>

			<h3>&hellip; But Had You Ignored Them You Could Have Turned $1,000 into Over $77,000<br class="hidebr"> in a Single Year!</h3>

			<p>When Bitcoin tanked 93% from $31.50 to $2.10, the media jumped at the opportunity to say that it was done for:</p>

			<p>Tech website Good called it &ldquo;funny money&rdquo; and said Bitcoin was a &ldquo;scam.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>WIRED published an article titled &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin&rdquo; claiming that Bitcoin was &ldquo;structured like a pyramid scheme&rdquo;...</p>

			<p>Forbes came out with a piece called &ldquo;So, That&rsquo;s the End of Bitcoin Then&rdquo;... claiming that Bitcoin had no use as a currency.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why most investors didn&rsquo;t get in on Bitcoin with all the negative media attention it was getting...</p>

			<p>But what they didn&rsquo;t know was that this &ldquo;100X Bitcoin&rdquo; pattern was playing out at that very moment&hellip;</p>

			<p>And all they had to do to make a fortune was place a simple trade.</p>

			<p>Because just over a year later...</p>
			<img alt="Bitcoin" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_Rally1.gif" />
			<p>You would have been up as much as 7,752%!</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s enough to turn every $100 into $7,752&hellip;</p>

			<p>And every $1,000 into a $77,520 windfall&hellip; in just over 12 months.</p>

			<p>This exact same pattern happened again a year later...</p>

			<h3>The Media Declared Bitcoin Dead<br class="hidebr"> Again in 2013&hellip;</h3>

			<h3>&hellip; Six Months Later it Shot up 2,382%!</h3>

			<p>The same thing happened in April 2013 when Bitcoin fell 79% from $240 to $50&hellip;</p>

			<p>Again, the media was convinced that Bitcoin was never coming back, and they weren&rsquo;t afraid to say it...</p>

			<p>Slate published an article saying &ldquo;Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme--the Internet&rsquo;s Favorite Currency will collapse.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Bloomberg published a piece saying &ldquo; Bitcoin is Doomed.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>And Business Insider stated that &ldquo;Bitcoin is a Joke&hellip; it has no intrinsic value&rdquo;...</p>

			<p>But, again, they were completely wrong&hellip;</p>
			<img alt="Bitcoin" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_Rally2.gif" />
			<p>The pattern was playing out again&hellip;</p>

			<p>And within eight months Bitcoin shot all the way up to $1,241!</p>

			<p>The crash was hardly even a blip on Bitcoin&rsquo;s radar...</p>

			<p>And anyone that was smart enough to invest in Bitcoin at $50 would have had the chance to capture as much as a 2,382% gain!</p>

			<p>Enough to turn every $100 invested into $2,382&hellip;</p>

			<p>And every $1,000 into $23,820!</p>

			<p>Are you starting to see the pattern yet?</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s another example&hellip;</p>

			<h3>Dozens of News Reports Predicted<br class="hidebr"> the End of Bitcoin in 2014&hellip;</h3>

			<h3>&hellip; Yet it Skyrocketed from $91.66 to Nearly $20,000 Just 3 Years Later</h3>

			<p>At the beginning of 2014, Bitcoin crashed 92% from over $1,200 to $91.66&hellip;</p>

			<p>Before the dust had even settled, Street Insider published an article titled &ldquo;Bitcoin is Dead.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>USA Today wrote: &ldquo;the precipitous decline in the currency is probably its death knell.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>And The Washington Post went on record saying &ldquo;R.I.P. Bitcoin. It&rsquo;s Time to Move On&rdquo;...</p>

			<p>We all saw what happened next...</p>
			<img alt="Bitcoin" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_Rally3.gif" />
			<p>By the end of 2017, Bitcoin was all the way up to $19,870!</p>

			<p>Once again, if you&rsquo;d simply ignored what the clueless mainstream media was saying and bought Bitcoin at its low point in 2014...</p>

			<p>You would have captured as high as a 21,577% gain in 3 years!</p>

			<p>Enough to turn every $1,000 into $215,577&hellip;</p>

			<p>And every $10,000 into a $2,155,770 retirement fortune!</p>

			<p>This 3-step millionaire-making formula has occurred three times throughout Bitcoin&rsquo;s history...</p>

			<ol class="numbers">
				<li><strong>Bitcoin crashes 70% or more... </strong></li>
				<li><strong>The media declares it &ldquo;dead&rdquo;</strong></li>
				<li><strong>It experiences a <em>tremendous</em> rally within a matter of months or years giving investors the chance to make a fortune!</strong></li>
			</ol>

			<p>And after the crash at the end of last year&hellip;</p>

			<p>This same pattern -- which has worked in 100% of its past occurrences -- is happening <em>right now</em>.</p>

			<p>But there&rsquo;s one key difference...</p>

			<h3>Bitcoin is Gearing Up for Its Biggest<br class="hidebr" />
				and LAST Rally Ever!</h3>

			<p>That brings us to Bitcoin&rsquo;s final crash, starting at the end of 2017&hellip;</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;re seeing this pattern play out again, right before our eyes&hellip;</p>

			<p>Bitcoin has now officially fallen more than 70% off its all time high...</p>

			<p>As usual, the media has published dozens of reports about &ldquo;the death of Bitcoin&rdquo;...</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s just a small handful of headlines we&rsquo;ve seen in the past few months:</p>

			<div class="newsquote2">
				<p>&ldquo;The Bitcoin Fad Is Over&rdquo;</p>
				<hr>
				<h5>Seeking Alpha</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="newsquote2">
				<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is Worthless&rdquo;</p>
				<hr>
				<h5>Bloomberg</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="newsquote2">
				<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is basically a Ponzi scheme&rdquo;</p>
				<hr>
				<h5> Seattle Times</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="newsquote2">
				<p>"Bitcoin is &#39;useless as a <Br class="hidebr">payment mechanism and ridiculous <Br class="hidebr">as a store of value&hellip;"</p>
				<hr>
				<h5>CNBC</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="newsquote2">
				<p>"Bitcoin is the greatest scam in history"</p>
				<hr>
				<h5> Recode</h5>
			</div>

			<div class="newsquote2">
				<p>&ldquo;Sell all crypto and abandon<Br class="hidebr"> all blockchain&rdquo;</p>
				<hr>
				<h5> Financial Times</h5>
			</div>

			<p>And as usual, the media is about to be proven dead wrong, just like they were in 2011, 2012 and 2014.</p>

			<p>Because I&rsquo;m convinced Bitcoin will follow the same pattern it has followed every crash throughout its history...</p>
			<img alt="Bitcoin" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_Rally4.gif" />
			<p>And it will mint a new round of millionaires, just like it has 3 times before!</p>

			<p>And, this time, it all starts when the U.S. Government issues their statement on September 30th...</p>

			<p>If their announcement goes the way industry insiders expect&hellip;</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;ll unleash a flood of institutional money into the crypto space&hellip;</p>

			<p>And dozens of financial institutions that have been sitting on the sidelines will finally be able to buy in...</p>

			<p>Which will likely add billions of dollars to Bitcoin&rsquo;s market cap...</p>

			<p>Sending it soaring past $100,000...</p>

			<p>All the way to $1 million with one single move!</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing you this urgent message&hellip;</p>

			<p>I can tell you with 100% conviction that this could be your last chance EVER to make a fortune in the crypto markets.</p>

			<p>And you have a VERY limited window of opportunity to act. In fact....</p>

			<h3>Bitcoin&rsquo;s Final Bull Run is Already Beginning&hellip;</h3>

			<h3>&hellip; And Every Moment You Wait, Somebody Else is Getting Rich!</h3>

			<p>If you think that the cryptocurrency markets have gone stale, just take a look at this snapshot I took a few days ago&hellip;</p>
			<img alt="Crypto Snapshot" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_BitcoinsFinalBullRun_Screenshot_001.png" />
			<p>Within the past few weeks at least 36 cryptos have doubled, tripled and quadrupled in price!</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s another recent snapshot from a single 24 hour period:</p>
			<img alt="Crypto Snapshot" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_BitcoinsFinalBullRun_Snapshot_002.png" />
			<p>BitF has gone up 338%...</p>

			<p>Vulcano has gone up 764%...</p>

			<p>And Ferron has skyrocketed an astounding 1,732%!</p>

			<p>Had you invested just $1000 in each one of those at the end of August&hellip;</p>

			<p>You would have walked away with $31,330 -- overnight!</p>

			<p>And this isn&rsquo;t a one-time thing, either.</p>

			<p>Everyday we&rsquo;re seeing tiny cryptos exploding 100%, 500% and even 1,000%&hellip;</p>

			<p>As you can see, the crypto markets are starting to gain some serious momentum&hellip;</p>

			<p>But as amazing as these gains are&hellip;</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s just the beginning&hellip;</p>

			<p>A small taste of what&rsquo;s coming.</p>

			<p>Because on September 30th, the United States Government will issue a statement&hellip;</p>

			<p>Changing the entire rules of the crypto game.</p>

			<p>And when they do, it could trigger a mad rush into cryptocurrencies.</p>

			<p>If you take a position right now&hellip;</p>

			<p>In the right cryptos (I&rsquo;ll discuss which ones I recommend)&hellip;</p>

			<p>You could turn a single $100 bill into a retirement fortune in the next 12 months.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll explain everything you need to know&hellip;</p>

			<p>But first, you&rsquo;re probably wondering who I am&hellip;</p>

			<h3>So allow me to back up<br class="hidebr"> and introduce myself...</h3>

			<p>Hi, my name is James Altucher.</p>

			<p>If my name sounds familiar, maybe you&rsquo;ve read one of my 18 books, including my best-sellers <em>The Power of No</em>, <em>Choose Yourself </em>and <em>Reinvent Yourself</em>&hellip;</p>
			<div class="changes pop">
				<img alt="JA Books" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/JA_Books.jpg" /></div>
			<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve read some of my articles published in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Financial Times</em> and <em>The New York Observer</em>&hellip;</p>

			<p>Or listened to my podcast &ldquo;The James Altucher Show,&rdquo; which has more than 20 million downloads.</p>

			<p>If you look me up online, you&rsquo;ll see that the popular website Wikipedia describes me as&hellip;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;A hedge fund manager, entrepreneur, best-selling author, venture capitalist and podcaster who has founded or cofounded more than 20 companies.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>I guess they forgot to mention I&rsquo;m also a computer nerd.</p>

			<p>I wrote my first computer program in 1982 on an Apple II+&hellip;</p>

			<p>And I&rsquo;ve been a coder and hacker for the past 35 years!</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this because when it comes to cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s a BIG deal.</p>

			<p>You see, these digital currencies are created by computer programmers.</p>

			<p>That means you can only fully understand them if you can read the code behind each currency.</p>

			<p>And that&rsquo;s my bread and butter.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve been able to help everyday folks who knew nothing about cryptos make a fortune in this new market.</p>

			<blockquote>
				“We’ve already tripled our investment in <br class="hidebr">cryptocurrencies thanks to James’ ideas and have become his (and cryptos) huge champions!”
				<span style="text-decoration: italic; font-weight: lighter;"><em><br>Theresa S.</em></span>
			</blockquote>
			<br>

				&ldquo;I dipped a toe into the crypto space just over a year ago and got my first ten-bagger!&rdquo;

			<blockquote>
				&ldquo;Thank you so much... I have more than tripled my initial investment!&rdquo;

			<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I&rsquo;ve built connections ranging from the head of Google X (Google&rsquo;s experimental laboratory), Paypal Founder Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban&hellip;</p>

			<p>Thanks to my network, I&rsquo;ve been able to get to know many of the computer geeks who are actually developing these currencies&hellip;</p>

			<p>And thanks to my nerdy background, I&rsquo;ve been neck deep in cryptocurrencies since 2013.</p>
			<p>In fact, that same year I created what was probably the first Bitcoin online &ldquo;store&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Where I pre sold my book <em>Choose Yourself</em> exclusively on Bitcoin.</p>

			<p>At the time, CNBC even invited me to talk about it on live TV.</p>

			<p>The anchor was totally skeptical of Bitcoin.</p>

		</div>

		<p>While I was telling everyone Bitcoin would succeed&hellip;</p>

		<p>The mainstream media was saying the exact opposite.</p>

		<p>A CNN op-ed even said it was &ldquo;a big scam designed to enrich its shadowy creators&rdquo;&hellip; and &ldquo;a bubble that could soon pop.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><strong>So if you missed the Bitcoin boom, it&rsquo;s not your fault.</strong></p>

		<p>The mainstream media simply &ldquo;brainwashed&rdquo; most Americans into thinking Bitcoin was a scam.</p>

		<p>Well, had you ignored the clueless mainstream media&hellip;</p>

		<p>And listened to what I said on CNBC instead&hellip;</p>

		<p>You would be up 6,753% today&hellip;</p>

		<p>And that&rsquo;s AFTER the recent pullback!</p>
		<img alt="Bitcoin" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_Chart_005_Bitcoin_v1.jpg" />
		<p>That&rsquo;s more than 67 times your money in the last five years&hellip;</p>

		<p>Enough to turn a small retirement account of 10 grand into a $675,300 retirement fortune!</p>

		<h3>And this wasn&rsquo;t the only time I&rsquo;ve made a major crypto prediction on TV that turned out to be right&hellip;</h3>

		<p>CNBC invited me back onto their show to talk about cryptocurrency again last year&hellip;</p>

		<p>And I predicted that 95% of digital currencies would turn out to be worthless.</p>

		<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="max-height:360px;max-width:640px; margin:0 auto; margin-bottom: 2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);">

		</div>

		<p>In other words, I predicted that this crash was going to happen -- months ahead of time when Bitcoin was still sitting at $4,000!</p>

		<p>And if you would have simply followed my prediction and stayed away from the &ldquo;scam&rdquo; alt coins&hellip;</p>

		<p>You could have avoided losing thousands of dollars in the recent crash&hellip; and still made a tidy profit on Bitcoin!</p>

		<p>Bottom line&hellip;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t expect the mainstream media to show you how to make a fortune from new tech trends, including digital currencies.</p>

		<p>Because they&rsquo;re always late to the party.</p>

		<p>Not to mention that most people still don&rsquo;t understand the power behind this 100X Bitcoin formula&hellip;</p>

		<p>Like I showed you earlier, our historical analysis PROVES this pattern would have been extremely profitable (as in an average of 100x your money)&hellip;</p>
		<div class="callOut">
			<p><strong>In 100% of the cases.</strong></p>
		</div>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve made it my mission to reveal the TRUTH about making money in this coming bullrun.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to set the record straight.</p>

		<p>So please pay close attention&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because in the next few minutes, I will show you how I&rsquo;m preparing for Bitcoin&rsquo;s final ascent&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll show you what I&rsquo;m doing with my own money&hellip; my family&rsquo;s fortune&hellip; the money I plan to leave to my kids and grandkids.</p>

		<p>Then you can decide for yourself if this is right for you.</p>

		<p>Because the truth is&hellip;</p>

		<h3>Dozens of Cryptocurrencies Could be About to Explode 3,475%, 21,611% and Even 81,465%... All Over Again!</h3>

		<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure you heard about the dozens of overnight millionaires that were minted during the last crypto &ldquo;mania&rdquo;...</p>

		<p>&hellip; when Bitcoin went from under $1,000 to over $20,000 within the span of a year.</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0px;">And it&rsquo;s no wonder when we saw gains like these happening on a weekly, and sometimes <em>daily </em>basis...</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to see how it was possible to turn as little as $100 into a life changing fortune with gains like these...</p>

			<p>In fact, if you had invested $100 into each of the coins you see above, you would have made as much as $358,000!</p>

			<p>And had you invested $1,000&hellip; You&rsquo;d have cashed out a certified multi-millionaire with $3,580,000 in the bank!</p>

			<p>Enough to instantly put you in the top 1% of the wealthiest families in America.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row col-12 container">
		<p style="Margin-top: 0px;">If you missed out on these explosive crypto gains, you&rsquo;re not alone.</p>

		<p>Most people had no idea what was going on.</p>

		<p>They didn&rsquo;t have anybody to show them how to get in on the action.</p>

		<p>But this time around, you have the opportunity to position yourself ahead of time.</p>

		<p>Of course, past performance doesn&rsquo;t always equal future success.</p>

		<p>There is no such thing as absolute certainty when it comes to investing&hellip;</p>

		<p>Which means you might not see gains 100% of the time.</p>

		<p>But do you see now why this may be the last chance you&rsquo;ll ever have to make a fortune in the crypto markets?</p>

		<p>But, here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;</p>

		<p>For a shot at the biggest gains, you MUST take action immediately...</p>

		<h3>Because After September 30th,<br class="hidebr" />
			It Will Be Too Late...</h3>

		<p>The announcement that the Securities Exchange Commission is going to make will trigger a buying frenzy&hellip;</p>

		<p>And help mint a new round of crypto millionaires.</p>

		<p>You see, <em>dozens</em> of funds are already finding ways of incorporating cryptos into their portfolios.</p>

		<p>But the announcement the SEC makes just days from now could unleash an estimated <em>$5.1 trillion</em> into the crypto space.</p>

		<p>You see, the market-moving financial institutions with <em>trillions </em>of dollars in spending power still don&rsquo;t have a way to get in on the action&hellip;</p>

		<p>And believe me when I tell you they are <em>desperate</em> to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies while they&rsquo;re still dirt cheap&hellip;</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve been waiting months for &ldquo;safe&rdquo; a way to get in on cryptos&hellip;</p>

		<p>So what would happen if an insured Bitcoin fund was created by one of the oldest, most reliable financial institutions in America...</p>

		<p>&hellip; And <em>fully endorsed</em> by the United States government?</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re about to find out&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because with the demand for Bitcoin rapidly building on the institutional side&hellip;</p>

		<p>With over 200 funds dedicated to cryptocurrency...</p>

		<p>And with the Chicago Board Options Exchange filing to bring a Bitcoin fund to the market&hellip;</p>

		<p>I am CERTAIN that the SEC will approve the first Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund!!</p>

		<p>They have no choice&hellip;</p>

		<p>And it could happen as soon as September 30<sup>th</sup> with this upcoming announcement.</p>

		<p>And once these multi trillion dollar institutions have a safe method for gaining exposure to cryptocurrency&hellip;</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll quickly see Bitcoin appear in every 401(k) and Pension plan in America!</p>

		<p>Even if these institutions only allocate 1% of their assets to cryptocurrency&hellip;</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re looking at an instant influx of $510 billion to the crypto markets.</p>

		<p>If they invest 2%, that&rsquo;s over a trillion dollars&hellip;</p>

		<p>If they invest 5%, that&rsquo;s $2.5 trillion...</p>

		<p>And if they invest 10% -- which my research shows is a <em>very</em> likely scenario based on their interest in the space...</p>

		<div class="callOut">
			<p><strong>$5.1 <em>trillion</em> will flow into the crypto markets&hellip;</strong></p>
		</div>

		<p>That&rsquo;s over <em>twenty times</em> the value of every cryptocurrency combined...</p>

		<p>Meaning that if you start with a modest stake in the right cryptos...</p>

		<p>&hellip; This time next year you could be relaxing at your beach house mansion overlooking the Caribbean on a 300 acre private island...</p>

		<p>With an army of private chefs, housekeepers and butlers waiting on your every need.</p>

		<p>It already happened to a bunch of people who got in after the past crashes in bitcoin.</p>

		<p>So you know it could happen to you too. It&rsquo;s not impossible...</p>

		<p>Especially when you consider that&hellip;</p>

		<h3>The decision the SEC will make on September 30th couldn&rsquo;t be clearer&hellip;</h3>

		<p>SEC Commissioner, Hester M. Pierce has already openly come out in support of a Bitcoin ETF&hellip;</p>

		<p>Even writing a 2,400 word public statement claiming that the rules of the exchange satisfy the SEC&rsquo;s requirements...</p>

		<p>And going on to say &ldquo;I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The SEC chairman Jay Clayton has said &ldquo;The technology on which cryptocurrencies and ICOs are based may prove to be disruptive, transformative and efficiency enhancing.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>One former SEC employee who left the organization just weeks ago told ICO Journal &ldquo;I would expect a positive outcome in September...&rdquo;</p>

		<p>And when asked about the decision, a representative from the CTFC said &ldquo;I would call it about 90% at this point.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Not to mention the overwhelming demand from the community for a Bitcoin ETF&hellip;</p>

		<p>Bloomberg just published an article titled:</p>

		<div class="newsquote2">
			<p>&ldquo;Frenzy to Get Bitcoin ETF Listed Is Clogging Up the SEC&#39;s Email&rdquo;
				<hr><br>
				<h5>Bloomberg</h5>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>Within 2 months of asking for feedback about this new ETF the SEC has received nearly 1,300 responses&hellip;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s over <em>14 times</em> the number of responses they received when they asked for feedback about a Bitcoin ETF earlier this year.</p>

		<p>And here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really exciting...</p>

		<p>The organization that is filing to bring the first Bitcoin ETF to the market -- The Chicago Board Options Exchange...</p>

		<p>Is the SAME organization that was approved for the first Bitcoin futures exchange&hellip;</p>

		<p>&hellip; which pushed Bitcoin to nearly $20,000 in December of 2017!</p>

		<p>Forbes even published an article recently saying:</p>

		<div class="newsquote2">
			<p>&ldquo;It is nearly impossible that we will not see Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC.&rdquo;
				<hr><br>
				<h5>Forbes</h5>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>The SEC has already stated that they&rsquo;ll announce their decision on September 30th&hellip;</p>

		<p>So this date is NOT speculation&hellip;</p>

		<p>They WILL make an announcement just days from now...</p>

		<p>And when they come out in favor of this new ETF, we&rsquo;ll see the price of Bitcoin go <em>nuclear</em>.</p>

		<p>How do I know? Put simply...</p>

		<h3>Every Time a Market Gets an ETF for the First Time, it Experiences a Flood of New Money</h3>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this exact situation play out numerous times before&hellip;</p>

		<p>You see, when a market gets an ETF approved for the first time, it&rsquo;s a monumental event&hellip;</p>

		<p>Because it gives pension funds with trillions of dollars in assets a way of buying in.</p>

		<p>Which sends money pouring into the market, pushing the asset higher...</p>

		<p>Giving investors the chance to strike it rich!</p>

		<p>Take Gold for example.</p>

		<p>When it finally got the greenlight for an ETF...</p>

		<p>$1.5 billion flowed into the market within two weeks!</p>

		<p>But the money didn&rsquo;t stop there&hellip;</p>

		<p>Years later in 2011, investors had poured as much as $74 billion into this ETF!</p>

		<p>And guess what all that flood of money did to gold?</p>
		<img alt="Money Metals Exchange Gold" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_Chart_005_MoneyMetalExchange_v1.png" />
		<p>The yellow metal soared 470% from $332 to $1,892!</p>

		<p>The same thing happened when the first silver ETF was approved&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="Money Metals Exchange Silver" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_Chart_006_MoneyMetalExchange_v1.png" />
		<p>As soon as the new ETF became available to financial institutions...</p>

		<p>The price of silver skyrocketed 242% from $14.22 to $48.75!</p>

		<p>And again with Palladium&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="Money Metals Exchange Palladium" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_Chart_007_MoneyMetalExchange_v1.png" />
		<p>Which soared from $448 to $1,112!</p>

		<p>Not bad, right?</p>

		<p>But as we&rsquo;ve seen with the explosive nature of cryptocurrency&hellip;</p>

		<p>The market&rsquo;s response to a Bitcoin ETF is almost guaranteed to be as much as 100X bigger!</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m certain that if Bitcoin&rsquo;s ETF is approved on September 30th&hellip;</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll see a flood of institutional money pour in&hellip;</p>

		<p>Pushing Bitcoin to an all-time high...</p>

		<p>Which is why you need to act RIGHT NOW.</p>

		<p>Because, like I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not the only one that sees this coming&hellip;</p>

		<h3>The Smart Money is Going All In...</h3>

		<p>With dozens of cryptocurrencies already exploding 338%, 764% and even 1,732% overnight...</p>

		<p>The smart money is chomping at the bit to get in on the action before the SEC makes their announcement...<br />
			<br />
			TheStreet.com even published an article featuring ex-hedge fund Billionaire, Mike Novigratz with following headline recently&hellip;<br />
			<br />
			<em>A &#39;Herd of Institutional Investors&#39; Is Moving Into Crypto</em> -- TheStreet.com</p>

		<p>And with over 226 crypto hedge funds currently in operation and more being started every week...</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the smart money is lining up at the gate for the single greatest rally in Bitcoin&rsquo;s history...</p>

		<p>Ronni Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, explains this gold rush:</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The floodgates are opening. I believe there are hedge funds and very deep-pocketed individuals going into this now, really hundreds of millions of dollars.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>And remember how I said that cryptos will soon be found in every 401(k) in America?</p>

		<p>Well, Fidelity, which has $2.45 trillion in assets under management, has just partnered with Coinbase, the most popular cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

		<p>Imagine what will happen if some of those trillions start moving into cryptos!</p>

		<p>Simply put, institutional investors are jumping in with both feet.</p>

		<h3>And to Prove My Point,<br class="hidebr" />
			Here&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Inside Scoop&rdquo;&hellip;</h3>

		<p>Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital are two of the most highly respected venture capital firms in Silicon Valley.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s because they tend to see major technology trends before anyone else.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve made billions by investing very early in social media companies like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.</p>

		<p>Simply put, when these guys invest in something new, you should pay close attention.</p>

		<p>Well, Fortune recently reported that Andreessen Horowitz has poured $300 million into a crypto investment fund.</p>

		<p>And Sequoia Capital has made at least eight investments in the space&hellip;</p>

		<p>Including two crypto hedge funds, three crypto exchanges and a cryptocurrency called &ldquo;Guanguan Coin.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>And they&rsquo;re not alone.</p>

		<p>My network allows me to see behind the scenes that the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; is now getting heavily involved in cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>My billionaire friend Mark Cuban is investing in it... Google is in it&hellip; and so is billionaire Richard Branson...</p>

		<h3>Even The Most Notorious Bitcoin Bears Are Starting To Smell The Money and Get In On The Action!</h3>

		<p>Take J.P. Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon for example&hellip;</p>

		<p>In September 2017 he went on record saying that &ldquo;Bitcoin is a fraud&rdquo; and he&rsquo;d fire any employee trading Bitcoin in a second.</p>

		<p>A few months later CNN published an article titled &ldquo;Jamie Dimon says he regrets calling bitcoin a fraud and believes in the technology behind it.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Now J.P. Morgan is diving into the crypto space head first&hellip;</p>

		<p>In fact, their internal systems are now being built on the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>They realize that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF will spark the next bull run -- and they don&rsquo;t want to be left out.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve even gone on record saying...</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin ETFs are the holy grail&rdquo; -- J.P. Morgan</p>

		<p>And going on to say that a Bitcoin ETF &ldquo;could have a transformational impact on the cryptocurrency.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The big players know we&rsquo;ll NEVER see a boom like this again.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why if you don&rsquo;t get in by September 30th, I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll regret for the rest of your life.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough&hellip; This is a &ldquo;now or never&rdquo; opportunity because...</p>

		<h3>The Supply of Bitcoin is Secretly Being Bought Up, Right Under Our Noses!</h3>

		<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize this, but Bitcoin has a limited supply.</p>

		<p>Meaning, unlike the U.S. dollar, it&rsquo;s impossible to &ldquo;print&rdquo; more Bitcoin.</p>

		<p>So once all of the Bitcoin is bought up, the price will go sky high&hellip;</p>

		<p>Of course, the &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; on Wall Street knows this&hellip;</p>

		<p>Which is likely why they&rsquo;re frantically loading up on as much Bitcoin as they can get their hands on before September 30...</p>

		<p>In fact, just the other day I was approached by a top trader from the NY stock exchange.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;James,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I have someone who desperately wants to buy $100 million worth of bitcoin. I will give you a million dollars if you can find me one.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>So I reached out to dozens of the biggest Bitcoin holders on my contact list&hellip;</p>

		<p>And NOBODY wanted to sell a single Bitcoin!</p>

		<p>In fact, they all told me that they wanted to buy MORE of it.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re all positioned to make a fortune when the announcement is made in favor of Bitcoin.</p>

		<p>My point is...</p>

		<h3>With All This Money Flowing In,<br class="hidebr" />
			<em>Right Now</em> is the Time to Create Generational Wealth as a Crypto Investor</h3>

		<p>Like I said earlier, 99.99% of Americans are going to miss out on this crypto boom.</p>

		<p>So imagine what it will be like months from now when you&rsquo;re one of the only people who saw this coming.</p>

		<p>Your family and friends will see you as a genius for identifying this pattern and taking action ahead of time.</p>

		<p>And as a result, you&rsquo;ll never have to work another day in your life.</p>

		<p>Again, when we&rsquo;re talking about massive once in a lifetime gains like these&hellip;</p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t need much money to position yourself for an enormous windfall.</p>

		<p>Remember when I said you could turn $100 into a retirement fortune?</p>

		<p>Look what happened with a little-known cryptocurrency called NEM.</p>

		<p>It has jumped as high as 291,142% in the last couple of years.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s enough to turn a single $100 bill into $291,242.</p>
		<img alt="NEM" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-15.png" />
		<p>That&rsquo;s more than three times what the average retiree has in their retirement account.</p>

		<p>Amazing, right?</p>

		<p>Imagine adding almost $300,000 to your nest egg&hellip;</p>

		<p>Starting with just $100&hellip; in just a couple of years!</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the power of these smaller cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<p>Or look what happened with the second biggest digital currency, Ethereum&hellip;</p>
		<img alt="Ethereum" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-16.png" />
		<p>Had you put in just $500&hellip;</p>

		<p>It would have ballooned into a retirement fortune of as much as $407,822&hellip; in just a couple of years.</p>

		<p>And if you invested a little more, you could&rsquo;ve literally walked away with millions.</p>

		<p>For example, a $5,000 investment in another cryptocurrency called SibCoin&hellip;</p>

		<p>Could have paid you a $2.8 million fortune&hellip; in a matter of months.</p>
		<img alt="SIBCOIN" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/LF/ALR/ALR_BitcoinsLastBullRun_092018/ALR_CryptoMasterClass_08_21_17_Chart-17.png" />
		<p>Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s even more incredible is that we&rsquo;re about to see an even bigger boom...</p>

		<h3>Unfortunately 99% of Americans Won&rsquo;t Have the Courage to Get Rich Beyond their Dreams</h3>

		<p>Look, if you&rsquo;re scared to invest in cryptocurrencies, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

		<p>You are NOT alone.</p>

		<p>Despite the massive amount of money flowing in from Wall Street&hellip;</p>

		<p>Despite all the newly minted millionaires from the last crypto boom&hellip;</p>

		<p>And despite the fact that this exact situation has played out THREE times before&hellip;</p>

		<p>Most people don&rsquo;t want anything to do with crypto.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re too afraid of market volatility to see this pattern developing.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why most Americans will completely miss this boom&hellip; and regret for the rest of their lives.</p>

		<p>Just like the last Bitcoin bull run, we&rsquo;ll see a flood of everyday investors put money into Bitcoin once its already too late&hellip;</p>

		<p>Sure, they may make 20%, 30%, maybe even 100% on their money if they get in soon enough.</p>

		<p>But the massive life changing gains will already be over once they finally get the nerve to jump in.</p>

		<h3>That&rsquo;s Why it&rsquo;s Critically Important That You Take Action BEFORE September 30th</h3>

		<p>With this announcement date already confirmed&hellip;</p>

		<p>This situation is so obvious&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s such a no-brainer&hellip;</p>

		<p>That even the media is starting to catch on&hellip;</p>

		<p>Take a look&hellip;</p>

		<div class="newsquote2" style="margin-top: 0px;">
			<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin <br class="hidebr">Crash is Over...&rdquo;</p>
			<hr>
			<h5>Medium</h5>
		</div>

		<div class="newsquote2">
			<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin could hit $60,000 in 2018&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
			<hr>
			<h5>CNBC</h5>
		</div>

		<div class="newsquote2">
			<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin&#39;s Latest Price Crash May Be Over&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
			<hr>
			<h5>Fortune</h5>
		</div>

		<div class="newsquote2">
			<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is Bouncing Back&rdquo;</p>
			<hr>
			<h5>CNBC</h5>
		</div>

		<div class="newsquote2">
			<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is Getting Bullish&rdquo;</p>
			<hr>
			<h5>Hacked.com</h5>
		</div>

		<div class="row small-12 column">
			<div class="newsquote2" style="margin-top: 0px;">
				<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin will bounce back <br class="hidebr">from its recent crash&rdquo;</p>
				<hr>
				<h5>Telegraph</h5>
			</div>

			<p>Luckily, this story hasn&rsquo;t gone full mainstream yet. Of course, there&rsquo;s always a small chance the SEC denies this Bitcoin ETF.</p>

			<p>That why, in a moment, I&rsquo;ll show you a strategy you can use to buy Bitcoin while mitigating your risk.</p>

			<p>But based on the evidence I showed you a moment ago, I&rsquo;m certain it will be approved.</p>

			<p>And once this announcement makes front page news of every financial newspaper in America, it will be too late.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s why I urge you to get in right now&hellip;</p>

			<p>Get ahead of the crowd&hellip;</p>

			<p>Ahead of the massive buying frenzy that will push cryptocurrencies on their biggest bull run ever.</p>

			<p>If you get in before September 30th &hellip;</p>

			<p>You could have a rare chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune.</p>

			<p>After that date, this window of opportunity will be slammed shut forever.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;ll never see an opportunity like this again&hellip; not in your lifetime.</p>

			<h3>But DO NOT Rush to Buy<br class="hidebr" />
				Every Cryptocurrency Out There!</h3>

			<p>You see, right now there are over 1,900 cryptocurrencies available.</p>

			<p>And if you blindly buy any of those&hellip;</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a 95% chance you&rsquo;ll lose all your money.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s because -- as I said on CNBC -- 95% of them are worthless&hellip; and will eventually go to zero.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth you won&rsquo;t hear anywhere else&hellip;</p>

			<p>Many of these digital currencies don&rsquo;t have the technology necessary to make them a viable form of money&hellip;</p>

			<p>Some can be printed willy-nilly&hellip;</p>

			<p>Others can be easily hacked&hellip;</p>

			<p>And others are simply a scam.</p>

			<p>How do I know that?</p>

			<p>Because aside from being a computer coder myself&hellip;</p>

			<p>I know other computer hackers who have looked into the codes of these currencies.</p>

			<p>For example, one of my contacts analyzed the cryptocurrency The DAO&hellip; and discovered it was very susceptible to hacking.</p>

			<p>I stayed away from that specific digital currency.</p>

			<p>Sure enough, it was hacked&hellip; and investors lost millions.</p>

			<p>Look, I&rsquo;ll be the first to concede that most of these tiny cryptocurrencies are risky speculations&hellip;</p>

			<p>But if you&rsquo;re avoiding ALL cryptocurrencies ahead of this announcement, well&hellip;</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;re costing yourself tens of thousands... even millions of dollars!</p>

			<p>Because the truth is&hellip;</p>

			<h3>Cryptocurrencies Are Here to Stay!</h3>

			<p>They&rsquo;re doing to money what the internet did to mail.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s the future of money.</p>

			<p>Saying cryptocurrencies are going away, it&rsquo;s like saying the internet is going away.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>

			<p>But you&rsquo;ll only make money if you buy the RIGHT cryptocurrencies!</p>

			<p>Remember what happened during the 1990s tech boom?</p>

			<p>A lot of people made a fortune during the boom.</p>

			<p>I personally made $15 million in 1998 alone.</p>

			<p>And those who invested in enduring companies like Amazon, Google and eBay got very, very rich.</p>

			<p>At the same time, scores of foolish day traders and IPO junkies got crushed&hellip;</p>

			<p>Because they invested in the wrong tech companies&hellip;</p>

			<p>Companies that were worthless garbage.</p>

			<p>That history is repeating itself right now in the cryptocurrency space.</p>

			<p>Only a handful of these digital currencies can really help you make money&hellip;<br />
				<br />
				I want to show you which ones.</p>

			<p>And don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t know a thing about cryptos.</p>

			<h3>Here&rsquo;s How to Claim It</h3>

			<p>To help you get started, I&rsquo;d like to send you a FREE crypto bonus package as part of a limited time offer you&rsquo;ll see in a moment.</p>

			<p>You see, every month I publish an elite income and opportunity newsletter called <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>.</p>

			<p>Inside this newsletter I give my best ongoing insights on the crypto market&hellip; the stock market&hellip; and other exciting money making opportunities I hear about through my vast network of venture capitalists and top-level investors.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll explain exactly what you&rsquo;ll find inside these value-packed monthly issues.</p>

			<p>First let me show you what you&rsquo;ll receive in your FREE crypto bonus package when you take a risk free trial of <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>&hellip;</p>

			<p>It includes a masterclass for beginners&hellip; my latest book&hellip;</p>

			<p>And my brand-new expos&eacute; <strong><em>Bitcoin&rsquo;s Final Bull Run: 3 Penny Cryptos Set to Explode 10,000% or More in the Coming Weeks.</em></strong></p>

			<p>You see, over the past several months I&rsquo;ve spent countless hours scouring the crypto markets&hellip;</p>

			<p>Reading the code behind hundreds of cryptos&hellip;</p>

			<p>And reaching out to every venture capitalist, hedge fund manager and cryptocurrency creator on my contact list&hellip;</p>

			<p>And I am now 100% certain that I&rsquo;ve found three tiny cryptos that could explode as much as 10,000% or more...</p>

			<p>Starting when the SEC makes their announcement in favor of Bitcoin ETFs as soon as September 30th.</p>

			<p>Inside this exclusive report I&rsquo;ll tell you the names of these cryptos&hellip;</p>

			<p>As well as how you can get in on them <em>before </em>they go mainstream.</p>

			<p>And don&rsquo;t worry if you know nothing about cryptos, because...</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;ll also receive a free copy of my book <strong><em>Cryptocurrencies 101: How to Make a Fortune From Digital Currencies</em></strong>...</p>

			<p>Where you&rsquo;ll find everything you need to get started&hellip;</p>

			<p>From the philosophy behind digital currencies&hellip; to opening an account&hellip; to finding the right currencies to buy.</p>

			<p>For example, you&rsquo;ll discover&hellip;</p>

			<div class="callOut">

				<p>***The #1 cryptocurrency to buy right now. (No, it&rsquo;s not Bitcoin.)</p>
			</div>

			<p>It&rsquo;s already up 2,406% since last year alone..</p>

			<p>But that&rsquo;s just the beginning. With Fortune 500 companies, like JP Morgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft, investing in this currency&hellip; the potential here is really explosive.</p>

			<p>Even better&hellip; it&rsquo;s trading for a fraction of Bitcoin&rsquo;s price.</p>

			<p>But it won&rsquo;t remain cheap for long. See the details on page 37.</p>

			<div class="callOut">

				<p>***The #1 mistake cryptocurrency investors are making right now.</p>
			</div>

			<p>This could be the most important part of the book.</p>

			<p>Because a lot of people who are making this mistake will get wiped out. But you will NOT be one of them. (See page 43.)</p>

			<div class="callOut">

				<p>***The computer geek secret to make sure your crypto account will NEVER be hacked.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Hint: You can do this even if you know nothing about computers. See page 25.</p>

			<div class="callOut">

				<p>***The 3-step screening process my team of venture capitalists used to pocket $1.8 million in a matter of months.</p>
			</div>

			<p>With these 3 simple steps, you&rsquo;ll be able to tell which cryptocurrencies are legit&hellip; and which ones are a scam.</p>

			<p>If a currency does not check all these 3 boxes, forget about it. (Page 50.)</p>

			<div class="callOut">

				<p>***How to invest in the booming cryptocurrency industry directly from your retirement account.</p>
			</div>

			<p>With this secret, you will not need to fill out extra paperwork&hellip; or open an account with a digital currency broker.</p>

			<p>You can even use your IRA. Simply follow my instructions on page 61.</p>

			<p>And much, much more&hellip;</p>

			<p>And don&rsquo;t worry, investing in cryptocurrencies is so easy a kid can do it&hellip;</p>

			<p>Just look at Erik F., a 12-year-old kid from Idaho.</p>

			<p>He started with a small investment of $1,000 in Bitcoin&hellip;</p>

			<p>And was able to turn that into a $1.2 million fortune.</p>

			<p>If he can do it, anyone can!</p>

			<p>And to make your life even easier&hellip;</p>

			<h3>This Package Also Includes An Exclusive 6-Video Series <em>Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies</em></h3>

			<p>You see, rather than just leaving you with a book&hellip;</p>

			<p>I wanted to walk you step by step through the entire process... on camera.</p>

			<p>So here&rsquo;s what I did&hellip;</p>

			<p>I used my contacts in New York to select four people who knew nothing about cryptocurrencies.</p>

			<p>I put them in a room with me&hellip; and got the cameras rolling.</p>

			<p>These are everyday folks just like you&hellip;</p>

			<p>People who want to make a fortune from cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

			<p>But don&rsquo;t know how to get started.</p>

			<p>I wanted to prove to you that anyone can do this.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve recorded everything and I&rsquo;d like to send you this 6-video masterclass for FREE.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll personally &ldquo;hold your hand&rdquo; and teach you everything I know about how to make money from cryptos.</p>

			<p>In a moment, I&rsquo;ll show you how you can access everything.</p>

			<p>First, you might be wondering why I&rsquo;d go through all this work&hellip;</p>

			<p>Why not just keep this information to myself and make a fortune?</p>

			<p>To answer that, let me tell you a very personal story that explains everything&hellip;</p>

			<h3>How My Bank Account Balance Went from $15 Million to Just $143</h3>

			<p>As I mentioned, I&rsquo;m already profiting from cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

			<p>And my team of venture capitalists even banked $1.8 million recently.</p>

			<p>But life has not always been this &ldquo;easy&rdquo; for me.</p>

			<p>You see, a few years ago I lost my entire life savings.</p>

			<p>Back in 1998, I made $15 million when I sold my first company, called Reset.</p>

			<p>But I was young and stupid.</p>

			<p>And within three and a half years, I went from millionaire to having just $143 left in my bank account.</p>

			<p>Let me tell you&hellip;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not a good feeling when you have no clue how you&rsquo;ll pay your mortgage&hellip; or your children&rsquo;s education.</p>

			<p>I was so broke and depressed that suicide crossed my mind.</p>

			<p>I thought maybe my two little girls would be better off with the $4 million payout from my life insurance policy.</p>

			<p>But then I recovered&hellip; got my act straight&hellip; and launched new, successful businesses.</p>

			<p>And here I am&hellip;</p>

			<p>Today I&rsquo;m doing everything I can to make sure my kids and grandkids will NEVER go through the financial nightmare I went through.</p>

			<p>And I don&rsquo;t want YOU to go through that either.</p>

			<p>Today you have a once-in-a-generation chance to secure a comfortable retirement&hellip; once and for all.</p>

			<p>I sincerely believe those who take the right steps today could make a killing from cryptocurrencies.</p>

			<p>A year from now, you could be traveling around the world&hellip;</p>

			<p>Spending time in your new luxury home in the south of France&hellip;</p>

			<p>Or simply drinking a cocktail with your loved ones in some exotic beach&hellip;</p>

			<p>With the peace of mind that only comes when you KNOW you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about money again.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m talking about making enough to fund your entire retirement&hellip;</p>

			<p>And still leave money for your kids and grandkids.</p>

			<h3>You Can Get Started Today with this FREE Cryptocurrency Package.<br> Here&rsquo;s How to Claim It</h3>

			<p>Even though cryptocurrencies are the best investment opportunity I&rsquo;ve seen in my 35- year career&hellip;</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not the only investment trend I follow.</p>

			<p>In fact, on the first weekday of every month&hellip;</p>

			<p>I publish a monthly income and opportunity briefing called <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>.</p>

			<p>I decided to launch this briefing because I know America is changing in profound ways.</p>

			<p>If you want a comfortable retirement&hellip;</p>

			<p>You can no longer rely on conventional institutions like the government, Wall Street firms or corporations.</p>

			<p>The truth is&hellip; if you don&rsquo;t choose the life you want to live&hellip;</p>

			<p>Chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you.</p>

			<p>And the results are probably not going to be pretty.</p>

			<p>And that&rsquo;s my mission in <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>&hellip;</p>

			<p>To help everyday American retirees end their reliance on conventional institutions&hellip;</p>

			<p>And learn how to grow your wealth and create your own streams of income&hellip;</p>

			<p>So you can live your retirement exactly how you want&hellip;</p>

			<p>Without EVER having to worry about money.</p>

			<p><strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong> is the only place where I&rsquo;ll personally update you on emerging new ways to earn more income and grow your wealth&hellip;</p>

			<p>It could be a new business idea&hellip;</p>

			<p>A potential deal with someone in my vast network of contacts&hellip;</p>

			<p>Or an explosive investment in a new, disruptive technology.</p>

			<p>Whenever I come across a unique opportunity, I&rsquo;ll tell you when to buy.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you when to sell.</p>

			<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you all of my analysis behind each recommended move.</p>

			<p>No guesswork.</p>

			<p>It couldn&rsquo;t get easier.</p>

			<p>And you can start today by claiming your FREE Cryptocurrency Package.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll send it to your doorstep as soon as you take a risk-free trial of <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>.</p>

			<p>My hope is that for you as a reader, it will be like having a wealthy friend who&rsquo;s a Silicon Valley insider&hellip;</p>

			<p>A friend who&rsquo;s an insider in the Manhattan financial world&hellip; and in the publishing and media world.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ll share secrets, insights and ideas I promise you won&rsquo;t hear anywhere else.</p>

			<p>But don&#39;t take my word for it.</p>

				<p>The same thing will happen with the crypto rush.</p>

			<p>That&rsquo;s a total value of nearly $1,000!</p>

			<p>But with today&rsquo;s special offer, you&rsquo;ll NOT pay anywhere near that.</p>

			<p>Here&rsquo;s what I propose&hellip;</p>

			<h3>&ldquo;Risk Nothing, Keep Everything&rdquo; Guarantee</h3>

			<p>Because of today&rsquo;s unprecedented situation in cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

			<p>And because you probably don&rsquo;t fully know me well&hellip;</p>

			<p>I want to make it as easy and hassle-free as possible for you to try my work.</p>

			<p>So I asked my publisher to lower the price down to a level that would barely cover our publishing costs.</p>

			<p>And we agreed on an incredible deal. Instead of paying the full value of $1,000... You&rsquo;ll only pay a tiny fraction&hellip; $49!</p>

			<p>And it means that for just 13 cents a day, you can have a full year&rsquo;s subscription of <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>.</p>

			<p>And you&rsquo;ll get everything else I promised today&hellip; including my Cryptocurrency Package.</p>

			<p><span style="background-color: #f1dc8c;"><strong>I&rsquo;ve also prepared a special &ldquo;risk nothing, keep everything&rdquo; guarantee.</strong></span></p>

			<p>When you sign up for <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>, we&#39;ll give you a full year to test out the service &mdash; <u>at no risk to you.</u></p>

			<p>During that year, you&rsquo;ll get 12 new issues &mdash; one a month.</p>

			<p>If, during those first 12 months, you find you&#39;re not satisfied with <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>&hellip;</p>

			<p>You can simply call or email our customer service team and cancel your subscription.</p>

			<p>We&#39;ll give you a full refund, no questions asked.</p>

			<p>And we&#39;ll let you keep everything you receive during your year as a subscriber &mdash; at no charge.</p>

			<p>You can keep your book <strong><em>Cryptocurrencies 101: How to Make a Fortune From Digital Currencies.</em></strong></p>

			<p>You can keep your <strong>6-video series <em>Masterclass on Cryptocurrencies.</em></strong></p>

			<p>You can keep all the issues&hellip;</p>

			<p>You can invest in the three penny cryptos set to explode 10,000% or more&hellip;</p>

			<div class="callOut">
				<p><em>And you can keep ALL four bonus gifts.</em></p>
			</div>

			<p><em>***You can keep everything. This means there&rsquo;s no risk to you at all.</em></p>

			<p>It&#39;s our way of saying thank you for giving <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong> a try.</p>

			<h3>But Please Let Me <br class="hidebr">Know Before September 30th</h3>

			<p>As I showed you today, the SEC is scheduled to make a big announcement on September 30th...</p>

			<p>Dozens of cryptocurrencies could explode 100%, 500% and even 1,000% or more&hellip; that day alone.</p>

			<p>If you wait until after the announcement, I&rsquo;m afraid it will be too late.</p>

			<p>The opportunity may be lost forever.</p>

			<p>Remember, this one of the most earth shattering financial events we&rsquo;ll ever witness.</p>

			<p>You will NEVER see this again&hellip; not in your lifetime.</p>

			<p>This could be your only and last chance to turn $100 into a retirement fortune with cryptos.</p>

			<p>It sure sounds impossible, but you know it&rsquo;s NOT!</p>

			<p>It already happened with Bitcoin, where just $100 invested seven years ago... would be worth $6.8 million today!</p>

			<p>And now it&rsquo;s happening again with smaller cryptocurrencies.</p>

			<p>Today I showed you how Alan A. used these cryptos to turn $8,500 into $7.5 million&hellip; in just six months&hellip;</p>

			<p>How Sean I. turned $15,000 into a $3 million fortune&hellip;</p>

			<p>And how I recently made an investment that returned $1.8 million from a single trade.</p>

			<p>When you think about it like that, you simply have to respond to this offer right away.</p>

			<p>There&rsquo;s really no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

			<p>Don&rsquo;t waste any time&hellip; or you will be left out!</p>

			<p>AND a no-risk trial subscription (at today&rsquo;s substantial discount) to my research service, <strong><em>The Altucher Report</em></strong>.</p>
